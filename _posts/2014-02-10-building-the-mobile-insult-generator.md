I had done it, one the glorious screen were the words *ugly turd pirate*.
Maybe not the most wonderful thing anybody's ever built, but the victory was
mine anyway. I find myself having less and less time to code stuff, thus this
was a particularly satisfying result as I managed to crank it out in about two
hours flat. Earlier in the day, I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1xa0k9/ill_be_ready_the_next_time_i_get_called/)
on reddit and felt myself inspired to build an app around this. Knowing that I
wanted to make this a mobile app, I figured on building it using responsive
bootstrap and leave it at that. Without further ado, here's the awesome mobile
insult generator.

Okay, so maybe not the most complicated thing in the world, but there was a
number of interesting things that went into this. First of all, it's built as
an entirely static web page, there's nothing server-side at all other than to
serve the content. The entire "trick" is to have the insult parts in
javascript, which is randomly selected client-side. To do this, I got to play
with [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) for the first time. The
*_.sample* function provided exactly the behavior I needed (randomly sample a
single element from the array. As the rest of the world has already
discovered, [underscore is cool](http://www.joelhooks.com/blog/2014/02/06/stop-writing-for-loops-start-using-underscorejs/).
As such, the code to pull this off was simply this:Â 
{% highlight javascript %}
first:  ['lazy', 'stupid', 'insecure', 'idiotic', 'slimy', 'slutty',
		'smelly', 'pompous', 'communist', 'dicknosed', 'pie-eating', 'racist',
		'elitist', 'white trash', 'drug-loving', 'butterfaced', 'tone deaf',
		'ugly', 'creepy'],

second: ['douche', 'ass', 'turd', 'rectum', 'butt', 'cock', 'shit', 'crotch',
		'bitch', 'prick', 'slut', 'taint', 'fuck', 'dick', 'boner', 'shart', 'nut', 'sphincter'],

third: ['pilot', 'canoe', 'captain', 'pirate', 'hammer', 'knob', 'box', 'jockey',
		'nazi', 'waffle', 'goblin', 'blossum',  'biscuit', 'clown', 'socket', 'monster',
		'hound', 'dragon', 'balloon'],

insult: function() {
	return _.sample(this.first) + ' ' + _.sample(this.second) + ' ' + _.sample(this.third);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Secondly, I learned how to host a github project page off of a custom domain.
The documentation wasn't exactly easy to follow. The bottom-line is that you
need a CNAME file in your gh-pages branch (btw, it MUST be named gh-pages,
no exceptions). In my case, the CNAME was *insult.barelycode.com*. With that
done, you just setup A records in your DNS pointing to the two IPs in the
[custom DNS documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages)
I wonder what happens if those IP addresses change?

Finally, adding the "Add to Home screen" turned out to be a lot easier than
I expected. There's [already a library](https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen)
to do this. The only "trick" is to create a link of type apple-touch-icon in
your html. And make sure that it's big enough (over 100px square) so that the
icon looks nice even on retina iPhone.

All in all, a reasonable effort. I showed this to the wife, whose only comment
was, "wow, how about you build something actually useful?"

*Small victories, small victories.*
