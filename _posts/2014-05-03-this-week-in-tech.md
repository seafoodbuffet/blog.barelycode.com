Here's a brief summary of the most interesting news stories this week in tech.

###[Facebook anonymous login](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/05/02/309025986/new-anonymous-facebook-login-hides-info-but-not-from-facebook)###

###[AWS changes access to secret keys](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/important-manage-your-aws-secret-access-keys/)###
AWS no longer allows you to access your secret keys so if you did save them
somewhere, you can no longer access them. You'll have to generate new secret
keys instead.
