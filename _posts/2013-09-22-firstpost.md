Yes, I guess the early 2000's called and they want their joke back. But
seriously, this is a blog about my adventures (and more importantly, complete
screw-ups) as I try to navigate a job at a burgeoning software company. In my
current position (Director of Engineering), I no longer get to write much
code anymore. I think don't think that's terribly different than many former
doers who are now managers (the police sergeant who keeps getting demoted to
avoid a desk job) it's one of the most difficult dynamics of wanting to do the
job yourself and never getting to because you know more important things need
your time. I think for me, the difficulty is that people are impossibly
irrational and difficult whereas code can always be bent to your will
(eventually).

So I've decided to start keeping this blog. I'm going to be spending time
learning to code stuff in my spare time (and every once in a while in my
actual professional job). I want to document successes and failures alike
and remember the satisfaction of getting some piece of code to actually
work. If, accordingly to [Malcolm Gladwell's book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)),
it takes 10,000 hours for greatness in any endeavor, then I wonder how long it
takes to scratch the itch of wanting to be slightly knowledgeable. For example,
I've probably invested at least 400 hours into PERL development, clearly
nowhere near expert but it's a tool I'm willing to leave as "well enough"
and thus only turn to it when I need. I wonder how many things I can
invest 100 hours into in order to feel satisfied.

Finally, I sometimes travel for my job, not as much as the global
jet-setters, but enough that I feel a sense of capable confidence
when I'm in the airport and watching people struggle with their
quart-sized shampoo bottles "but it was in a clear plastic bag!".
I'll leave random travel advice from time to time here as well.
