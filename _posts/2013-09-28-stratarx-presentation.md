Recently, I had the opportunity to give an Ignite talk at the StrataRx conference,
which just ended in Boston. Ignite is a talk format that stipulates exactly
five minutes, exactly twenty slides, and slides auto-advance every fifteen
seconds. The format provides for what seems like an easy presentation, how
hard could it be to come up with five minutes of material? However, my
experience was the exact opposite. I found the five minute format, coupled with
the auto-advance of the slides made for a huge preparation requirement.

When you have only five minutes, not forty-five, you are forced to be extremely
economic with your words. When slides advance automatically, you have to figure
out a way to nail your timing. There's no time for the extra uhhhhs or umms or
any of the usual pauses that we insert into normal speech.

I found the format challenging, but as someone who loves presenting, I also
thought it was great fun and the capsule of information format meant that ten
people can present in a little over an hour.

Here's what I learned:
  * Preparation is key.
    Even the Ignite talk organizers stressed that preparation was key. This is
    a point that cannot be over-stressed. I literally practiced my talk no less
    than 50 times in the lead-up to the presentation itself. Your careful prep
    will make your actual presentation seem effortless. People will be amazed
    the way your voice syncs with the slides. But only the presenter knows the
    amount of work that went into preparing.

  * Economy of words.
    I don't mean be terse, but remember that you have your voice AND your
    slides. In this case, there's no room for duplication. Make sure your
    slides can be read and absorbed in fifteen seconds, ideally very few
    words, mostly graphics/images. For example, if you're showing a comparison
    case study, don't bother stating whatever exact numbers that are presumably
    illustrated by your slides, rather, simply state the conclusion that your
    audience should take away from your slide. Also, you have no time for
    detailed explanation, so don't try. Instead, go straight to the heart of
    what you're trying to say.

  * Leave yourself room.  Â 
    During my trial runs, I rarely gave the presentation exactly the same way
    over of over. Having less than fifteen seconds of speaking content on each
    and every slide will afford you room to recover (you WILL be nervous),
    to catch up (if you start rambling), or to insert dramatic pause for effect.

*That last point is particularly important. One of the most poignant moments
of the presentations was when one of the speakers chose to take a short swig
of water. But the silence amongst the otherwise staccato of rapid-fire
speaking of the rest of the presentation was particularly memorable. Kudos
if that was planned and rehearsed.*

How did I do? Well you can see for youself in the permanently memorialized video
