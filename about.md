Former developer, former engineering manager, former consultant, now back to being a developer. I'm older, probably more stupid, but just as eager to do cool stuff. I work at [The Advisory Board Company](https://www.advisory.com). I work with dev teams, help make healthcare better, I can't wait to write better code. Check out my current project [HealthPost](https://healthpost.com) connecting people with healthcare.

This blog is built using the wonderfully easy [Poole](http://getpoole.com) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) which itself uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). Check out the [source code](https://github.com/poole) for Poole.

Thanks for visiting my own little corner of the internet.
